## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I´d never developed a slideshow before, that´s why I chose this challenge as my first for Frontend Mentor.
I did some research about slideshows but in the end I picked the one that made me fell more comfortable (DOM manipulation with JS and CSS keyframes).
